# Porting nzbget to Rust

nzbget moves to Rust one routine at a time. The Rust code lives in `rust/` and
builds as a static library (`cmake/rust.cmake`). C++ calls it through the C ABI
in `rust/include/nzbget_rs.h`.

## Rules

- Each port matches the C++ output byte for byte, quirks included. A behavior
  change is a separate commit.
- Before each swap, a differential fuzz runs the old C++ against the Rust code.
  The C++ version remains as a fallback for platforms without Rust integration.
- Measure before and after; port the hot paths first.

## Done

| C++                                   | Rust                       | Speed-up |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------|
| `WebUtil::JsonEncode`                 | `escape::json_encode`      | 1.9x     |
| `WebUtil::XmlEncode`                  | `escape::xml_encode`       | 1.6x     |
| `WildMask::Match`                     | `wildmask::wild_match`     | 1.4x     |
| `WebUtil::DecodeBase64`               | `decode::base64_in_place`  | 3.2x     |
| `WebUtil::JsonNextValue`              | `decode::json_next_value`  | 4.5x     |
| `WebUtil::JsonDecode`                 | `decode::json_decode`      | 2.3x     |
| `Crc32::Combine`                      | `crc::combine`             | 135x     |
| `WebUtil::XmlDecode`, `XmlStripTags`, `XmlRemoveEntities`, `HttpUnquote`, `UrlDecode`, `UrlEncode`, `Latin1ToUtf8` | `text` | port only |
| `WebProcessor` header, URL, credential and IP checks | `webserver` | port only |
| `Decoder` (yEnc, UU, raw; rapidyenc kept) | `decoder` | parity |
| `Scheduler::CheckTasks` timing (tasks run in C++) | `scheduler` | port only |
| `XmlCommand` request parameters (`PrepareParams`, `NextParamAsInt/Bool/Str`) | `rpcparams` | port only |
| `XmlRpcProcessor` routing (`Execute` protocol, `Dispatch` method/id/params) and `BuildResponse` envelope | `rpcroute` | port only |
| `Util::SplitCommandLine`, `Trim*`, `SanitizeLine`, `EndsWith`, `FormatBuffer`, `WebUtil::ParseRfc822DateTime` | `util` | port only |
| `ServerVolume::CalcSlots` and `AddStats` slot clearing (StatMeter) | `statmeter` | port only |

Each port has a differential test in `rust/tests/` that compares it with the
pre-port C++ under ASan and UBSan.

## Parked

- NZB parsing (`NzbFile::Parse`, libxml2 SAX1): a Rust parser that matches
  libxml2's callbacks exactly. All 5,929 NZBs on the test server plus 9,000
  mutated documents match or are left to libxml2. It is still about 25%
  slower than libxml2 on a 17.6 MB NZB, so it is not merged.

## Next

1. The rest of `WebUtil` and `Util`: RFC 822 dates, URL parsing,
   `Util::MatchFileExt`, `SplitCommandLine`, `Tokenizer`, size and speed
   formatting.
2. JSON/XML-RPC response building (`XmlRpc.cpp`), then the RPC server.
3. Queue state files (`DiskState`).
4. The download path (NNTP connection, article writer), then queue and
   post-processing. Each step leaves nzbget a working program.

## Build and verification

Native POSIX builds use Rust when Cargo, rustc, and the target standard library
are available; otherwise they retain the C++ encoders. Debug selects Cargo's dev
profile; other CMake configurations select release. Cargo is invoked on each build to track its own
sources, lockfile, build scripts, and configuration. Both the daemon and test
executable inherit the archive and Rust's native link dependencies.
Static executable builds select Rust's static CRT dependencies as well.

Windows keeps the original C++ encoders, so its existing build does not acquire a
Rust dependency. Non-macOS cross builds also keep C++ unless a matching target is
provided with `-DNZBGET_RUST_TARGET=<triple>`. macOS selects the target from the
CMake architecture and forwards `CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`. Install the Rust
standard library for the chosen target to enable Rust for that architecture.
An explicit `NZBGET_RUST_TARGET` requires a working Rust toolchain and standard
library; a missing dependency is an error rather than an automatic fallback.

Run `cargo test --release` in `rust/` for encoder and FFI tests. On POSIX with a
C++ compiler supporting ASan/UBSan, run `python3 rust/tests/differential.py` from
the repository root for a deterministic comparison against the exact encoder
bodies in commit `78dcb938`. This covers arbitrary bytes, embedded NULs, invalid
continuations, truncations, and out-of-range code points.
